$WW,1$A $LK,"CSprite",A="MN:CSprite"$ is an ordered list of $LK,"these",A="MN:SPT_END"$ elements, created with $FG,2$<CTRL-r>$FG$.	Normally, they are packed together in a list and the address of the first is passed to routines.

See $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.ZC"$, $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.ZC"$, $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/SpritePut.ZC"$, $LK,"::/Demo/Graphics/SpriteRaw.ZC"$ and $LK,"SpriteMeshEd",A="MN:SpriteMeshEd"$().

Be aware that copying $FG,2$SP$FG$, $FG,2$IB$FG$, or $FG,2$IS$FG$ entries with the clip results in duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by editing with $FG,2$<CTRL-t>$FG$ and setting to the original num.

See $LK,"::/System/Gr/GrSpritePlot.ZC",A="FL:::/System/Gr/GrSpritePlot.ZC,1"$ for how CSprite are stored.$FG$
