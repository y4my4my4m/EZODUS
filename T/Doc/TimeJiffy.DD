$WW,1$One jiffy is one time slice.	$LK,"counts.jiffies",A="MN:CCountsGlobals"$ returns time slices since boot.

$LK,"SysTimerRead",A="MN:SysTimerRead"$ reads the timer ticks since boot.  It's not as fast as $LK,"TSCGet",A="MN:TSCGet"$.

Use $LK,"JIFFY_FREQ",A="MN:JIFFY_FREQ"$ to convert $LK,"counts.jiffies",A="MN:CCountsGlobals"$.

Use $LK,"SYS_TIMER_FREQ",A="MN:SYS_TIMER_FREQ"$ to convert $LK,"SysTimerRead",A="MN:SysTimerRead"$.
