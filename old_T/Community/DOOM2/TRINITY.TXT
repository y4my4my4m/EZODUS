   (This version fixes the V_BadDrawPatchDirect bug which plagued the
    previous version. There are also some minor cosmetic fixes.)

The new textures were put together using DoomTex, available at
infant2 as dmtex10b.zip. As you can see, it works. I highly
recommend it. But then, I'm biased.

One area has a HOM in DOOM 1.2 which goes away with 1.6.
To use 1.6:
        registered 1.2 WAD => doom12.wad
        shareware 1.6 WAD  => doom.wad
        doom16 -file doom12.wad trinity.wad
Multiplayer 1.6 has an extra sprite called IFOG. Get your local
Doom guru to sort this out, or read the available info on
patching 1.6.
When 1.666 comes out, it _should_ be directly compatible.

Elias has looked at the Bad V_DrawPatchDirect problem.
It is gone.

I always told myself if I was going to write a level that it
would not have really slow bits, but the setting demands that
one area is slow, at least on my machine. Oops. Sorry, me.

One thing that really pisses me off is that the GUS sound code
gets slower with every incarnation of DOOM. Why oh why? I hope
Paul "sound-dork" Radek is twitching on a spike outside the
iD offices.
