Yeah welcome to aiwnios.com's motherfuckin IRC server
Time 2 get lit

  Oh and be sure to disable SSL,this is a 1990's style server(aiwnios doesnt like SSL)

  Set a password in your client before connect next time(use a burner one as traffic is logged here currently). This password cannot change for now so dont mess it up.

  I only store Password hashes in the Registry,so hackers will have to decipher the Aiwnios HashStr thing. Probably unlikley to happen. You can also not use a password too.

  See https://aiwnios.com/gihon for more details.
