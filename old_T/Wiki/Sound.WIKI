= Sound
TempleOS makes sounds(no no it's true).
Lets get started using an ONA(which is not a frequency in hertz,use Freq2Ona(hz)).
 I64 o;
 for(o=60;o!=100;o++) {
     Snd(o);
     Sleep(33);
 }
 Snd; //Turn off sound
This is fun and all,but what about music. For that we typeically use Play
Here is an example scale
 Play("wChDqEeFwGwAwB");
The notes of a music scale start with C through G,then A and B go on top.
What are the letters before the notes,they are note-lengths
|Letter|Note length
|w| whole
|h| half 1/2
|q| quarter 1/4
|e| eigth 1/8
|t| 2/3's of current duration
|.| 1.5 times the current duration
Sharp notes are denoted with a # after the note
== Tempo
The tempo(speed) of the music can be set with /music.tempo/
 music.tempo=8;
 Play(
     "hEhEwEhChEwGqG"
     "wCqGqEqAqBqA#qAqGhEhGwAhFhGwEhChDqB"
     "wCqGqEqAqBqA#qAqGhEhGwAhFhGwEhChDqB"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wEqG#qAhCqAhChD"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wE.wC.wC.wC"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wEqG#qAhCqAhChDwD#wDwC"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wEqG#qAhCqAhChD"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wE.wC.wC.wC"
     "hGhF#hFhD#wEqG#qAhCqAhChDwD#wDwC"
 );
Staccato is the spacing between the notes,it can be set via /music.stacatto_factor/ . It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0
 F64 s=0.;
 for(;s<=1.0;s+=0.25) {
     music.stacatto_factor=s;
     Play("hChDqEeFhGhAeB");
 }

= Noise
This makes a noise that is epic and sounds like an atari game. Use *Noise*
 Noise(500,1,100); //Make a noise for 500 milliseconds between 1 and 100 ona's
