= Print
Printing in TempleOS means printing to the screen(not to paper).
If you want to print a string,just type the string like this:
 "Hello World\n";
You could also type 
 Print("Hello World\n");

== Basic formatting
The print routine in TempleOS takes some (or no) arguments,you provide arguments like this:
 "%d,%d,%d\n",1,2,3;
The arguments are 1,2, and 3 here and the format code is *d*(Integer decimal). 
There are various formatting codes for different types of data,to use a floating point number,use *n*
 "Pi is %n\n",3.14;
The basic formatting codes are:
|Code| Meaning |Type 
|d|Integer|I64
|S|Define string|U8*
|C|Uppercase charactor|U8/U64
|p or P|Pointer to named symbol|Pointer
|x or X|Hexidecimal|Pointer/I64
|D|Date|CDate
|T|Time|CDate
|q|Quoted string(turns '/" into escape sequences)|U8*
|Q|Reverse quoted string|U8*
|Z|DefineLst entry(Takes 2 arguments)|U8 * and I64 
|z|Sub-entry of \0 terminated string(Takes 2 arguments)|U8 * and I64 
== z/Z Formating
/DefineLst/'s are things whose items are separated by "\0"s,they look like this
 DefineLstLoad("SOME_LIST","a\0b\0c\0");
We can use the list like this:
 DefineLstLoad("SOME_LIST","a\0b\0c\0");
 I64 i;
 for(i=0;i!=3;i++)
   "HERE:%Z\n",i,"SOME_LIST";;
== Auxiliary value
The auxiliary value does various things for different format codes.
For *c*,it repeats the character X times,we can do it like this:
 "c%h3cl\n",'o';
For numbers,it will set the decimal point of the number(useful for F64's).
For example if we want to view a number in units of 1000,we can do this
 "%h3n\n",1234567.;
We get do negative numbers too for "milli" units
 "%h-3n\n",0.123456;
We can have the Print routine choose auxiliary for us using "?".
 "%h?n\n",1234567.;
This is really cool. We can use an arbitrary value as the auxiliary value using "*".
 I64 repeat=10;
 "t%h*cn\n",repeat,'e';
== Other Print Routines
Somtimes you may want to Print text to a variable and use it elsewhere. For this we have *MStrPrint*,which will print a string to a *MAlloc*ed string and we can use elsewhere.(Be sure to *Free* it)
 U8 *str=MStrPrint("I have %d onions",123);
 PopUpOk(str);
 Free(str);
